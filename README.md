# Shape Shifter
## An HTML5 Columns clone!

### The rules are the same as in the classic Sega game:
Use the **left** and **right** arrow keys to move the falling column left and right. Use the **up** arrow key to shuffle the cells within the falling column. Use the **down** arrow key to automatically place the falling column.

Once the falling column lands, if three or more cells of the same colour are connected in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, those cells will disappear.

Play for as long as possible. The more cells you match, the higher your score!

### Notice a bug?
That's bound to happen. Create an issue and let me know about it! In addition, the code is open-source, so if you think you've found a solution, go ahead and create a pull request.
